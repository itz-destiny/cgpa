 * @file Firestore Security Rules for GradeRight

 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 * @data_structure All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *   - All write operations require a valid, authenticated user.
 *   - Data consistency between the path and document `id` field is enforced.
