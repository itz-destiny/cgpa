/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the GradeRight application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/semesters/{semesterId}: Stores semester data for a specific user. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own semesters.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - The rules are designed to be flexible on data shapes to allow for rapid iteration but will enforce the authorization model.
 * - All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's ID to prevent unauthorized data modification.
