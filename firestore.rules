/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GradeRight application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only
 * access their own data.  It prioritizes security by default and requires
 * explicit allowances for broader access.  Data schema is not strictly enforced
 * to allow for rapid prototyping, but authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the authenticated user
 *   can read or write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/semesters/{semesterId}: Stores semester data for a specific
 *   user. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own semester data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - The 'id' field within user and semester documents is used for authorization
 *   and is immutable after creation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'id' field in both the User and Semester entities is used to ensure that
 * the document ID matches the user ID, providing a reliable way to enforce
 * ownership without additional reads. This prevents needing to query a separate
 * collection to check ownership.
